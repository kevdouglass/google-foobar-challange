# google-foobar-challange
While researching Python's Pandas dataframe documentation for data science &amp; machine learning related keywords I ran accross this challange from Google.  I have heard that once completed, one could potentially be contacted for an interview with Google. Please note there are others out there that say they finished and were not contacted. I guess we'll find out :)
